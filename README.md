# Alex's Project Overview

## Game Title is 'Dunk Man' 
- the purpose of the game is to guess the letters of a randomly generated word (think 'hangman')
- the user would have to guess the word's letters in six guesses or less (7 would equal the body of dunkman: 2 legs, body, 2 arms, head and a basketball he dunks on you)
